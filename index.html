              <h5 class=>Tradition since 2002</h5>
              <p>I am the founder of “Roo’s Catering Services”, but the work behind the scene has been done by my Mother in law. This all started when I got married and shifted to my new house, where I bought a private bunglow which had pretty good space but only two of us to live in. So I requested my inlaws to move in with us.
                    That’s when I started to know her and since I did not know how to cook at all, she helped and taught me how to cook , as she was an awesome cook. So we both helped each other, I worked on the technology side and she was able to cook and display the product.
                    First we added some blog’s and then as soon as it started getting famous, we started with our catering services</p></div>
